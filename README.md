# WorldOfChemistry
You may pull request features that are from the Chemistry Update for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and I may look in to adding them into my mod if the features are correctly implemented. If a pull request is given, I will modify the code if some parts are different from the rest of the code that I have given in this repository. (unless it already is similar to my code or based on it)

# Ideas of things you can add and are currently missing from my mod
* Better crafting implementations for bleach by making it not work with a plain, white banner
* Other crafting recipes that are in the update
* Brewing recipes for the curative items
* Compound Creator recipes
* Lab Table recipes
* GUI's for the blocks
* Ice Bomb
* Super Fertilizer
* Balloons
* Glow Sticks
* Sparklers
* Underwater Torch
* Lab Table (directional*)
* Material Reducer (directional*)
* Element Constructor (directional*)
* Compound Creator (directional*)
* Underwater TNT
* Heat Block
* Colored Torches (light isn't actually colored)
* Hardened Glass and Glass Panes

\*Directional like furnaces

# Missing release versions
I know how to tag specific commits in GitHub using the command-line, but I do not know how to add release notes. So release versions before v0.2-alpha aren't tagged in the releases for now. v0.2.1-alpha isn't tagged in the releases because I accidentally tagged it to the master branch instead of the specific commit. 
* v0.2.1-alpha: 1b48939
* v0.1.1-alpha: 310012a
* v0.1-alpha: 6d52344
