# WorldOfChemistry
You may pull request features that are from the Chemistry Update for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and I may look in to adding them into my mod if the features are correctly implemented. If a pull request is given, I will modify the code if some parts are different from the rest of the code that I have given in this repository.

# Ideas of things you can add and are currently missing from my mod
* Better crafting implementations for bleach and how it is used
* More elements
* Other crafting recipes that are in the update
* Ice Bomb
* Super Fertilizer
* Balloons
* Glow Sticks
* Sparklers
* Compounds
* Underwater Torch
* Lab Table
* Material Reducer
* Element Constructor
* Compound Creator
* Underwater TNT
* Heat Block
* Colored Torch
* Hardened Glass and Glass Panes
